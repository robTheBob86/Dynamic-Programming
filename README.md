# IMPORTANT

These are a few **possibly non-working code-snippets** for a small programming assignment we had in a course on Dynamic Programming. 
The task was to initialize a grid-world, see example, in which an optimal path had to be found by dynamic programming, comparing value iteration and policy iteration. 
An argument shoud've been able to be handed over which consists of the path to the grid-world. This coud've been solved easier by sys.argv, but this looks of course better.
